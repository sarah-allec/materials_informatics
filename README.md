This repository holds a variety of `python` notebooks for materials informatics, which is the application of machine learning to materials science (for a good introduction, see <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-in-materials-informatics-41ee34d5ccfe" target="_blank">here</a>). To install the required packages needed to run the notebooks:

```sh
